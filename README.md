# Final_Project_v1

How to use this repo:

1. Open the Cars Price Prediction Final notebook and ensure you have all packages installed
2. The notebook uses the carsdataset.csv file, which contains vehicle data from the car website Edmunds
3. The notebook can be run to find what features are most important in determing price, using Linear and Random Forest regressions

#### Results of this analysis:
- Engine HP was the most important feature in determining a car's price, followed by the car make, model, and how many cylinders the engine has. While the make and model were expected, it was surprising to see how closely correlated engine HP was with price. 
- Other factors that might have had more influence, such as transmission type (automatic vs. manual) and MPG, did not have much of an impact in predicting car price.
